            <p>Back in the 19th century, the Spaniards were still colonizing of the Philippines. Through the common belief of those Filipinos who were against the ruling of the colonizers, the revolutionary group, Kataas-taasan, Kagalang-galangan, Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (KKK) or Katipunan, was formed in 1892. Katipunan, which is equivalent to association in English, is derived from its root word, tipon, which means to gather or to meet. The initiators were Andres Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Deodato Arellano and Valentin Diaz among others. Their first meeting was on July 7 because of the banishment of Dr. Jose Rizal to Dapitan. Starting with only a few members, the group expanded through having a rigorous recruitment process. This process allows a member to recruit as much members as he can, but they have to pass a lot of challenges.</p>

Teodoro Patiño informed his sister that he was a member of the said group, which left her disappointed. She seeked advice from her superior in the orphanage she was working out, and the information was relayed to a priest in Tondo. After receiving the leaked information, the Spanish authorities seized the opportunity to gather evidence against the group, and hundreds of members were arrested.</p>

They were asked by Bonifacio regarding their will to fight, and the members approved. He then rallied the members to tear their cedulas, which were the licenses back then, to show their objection against the Spanish reign. This was noted as the Cry of Pugadlawin.</p>

Aguinaldo eventually won in the Tejeros Convention, which made him the president of the group. With Bonifacio feeling betrayed in the group he had founded, he opposed the new revolutionary administration, and he was arrested by Aguinaldo. Aside from being arrested, Bonifacio and his brother, Procopio, were both beaten up and were sentenced to death in 1897. They were eventually shot dead by a firing squad in Maragondon, Cavite.</p>

					<p>After the death of Bonifacio, Aguinaldo took over as the leader of the group. The revolution continued although the rebels were on the losing end. The Spanish and the rebels decided to cease the bloodshed if Aguinaldo went to exile, which he did. The ceasefire didn’t last because the two sides did not trust each other. After the continuation of the war, the Malolos Republic was established, but this was destroyed by the American forces. The group was dissolved after the capture of Aguinaldo by the Americans in 1901.</p>

                    <p>Dubbed as “The Father of the Philippine Revolution,” Bonifacio founded the Katipunan together with Ladislao Diwa, Teodoro Plata, Deodato Arellano, Valentin Diaz, and Jose Dizon, under the presumption that freedom can only be attained through revolution. In the early stages of the Katipunan, Bonifacio became one the chief officers of the Katipunan. He served as the comptroller and the fiscal of the group, which made him responsible for its expenses and finances. Within the group, Bonifacio built a strong friendship with Emilio Jacinto, who became his confidant and adviser. Bonifacio even adopted Jacinto’s Kartilya primer as the official teachings of the group rather than his Decalogue. Also, Bonifacio and Jacinto, together with Pio Valenzuela collaborated on the group’s organ, Kalayaan which only had one printed issue. Under the pseudonym Agapito Bagumayan, he wrote several pieces for the paper including the poem, Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa. The publication of the Kalayaan resulted in the rapid increase of membership in the Katipunan. At the start of the Philippine Revolution, he reorganized the group into an open de facto revolutionary government. They named the nation and the government as Haring Bayang Katalugan, with him as President and commander-in-chief (or generalissimo) of the rebel army and the Supreme Council as his cabinet. He then gathered thousands of Katipunan members as they officially declared a nationwide armed revolution against the Spanish regime in the “Cry of Pugad Lawin.”</p>

                    <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Emilio Aguinaldo</h3>
                    <p>Emilio Aguinaldo was inducted by Andres Bonifacio himself into the Katipunan in 1894. While many of the Katipunan rebel bands were ill-trained and had to retreat in the face of Spanish forces, Aguinaldo's troops were able to out-fight the colonial troops even in pitched battle. Aguinaldo's men drove the Spanish from Cavite. However, they came into conflict with Bonifacio, who had declared himself president of the Philippine Republic, and his supporters. In March of 1897, the two Katipunan factions met in Tejeros for an election. The assembly elected Aguinaldo president in a possibly fraudulent poll, much to the irritation of Andres Bonifacio. He refused to recognize Aguinaldo's government; in response, Aguinaldo had him arrested two months later. Bonifacio and his younger brother were charged with sedition and treason and were executed on May 10, 1897, on Aguinaldo's orders. This internal dissent seems to have weakened the Cavite Katipunan movement. <br> In June of 1897, Spanish troops defeated Aguinaldo's forces and retook Cavite. The rebel government regrouped in Biyak na Bato, a mountain town in Bulacan Province, central Luzon, to the northeast of Manila. Aguinaldo and his rebels came under intense pressure from the Spanish and had to negotiate a surrender later that same year. In mid-December, 1897, Aguinaldo and his government ministers agreed to dissolve the rebel government and go into exile in Hong Kong. In return, they received legal amnesty and an indemnity of 800,000 Mexican dollars (the standard currency of the Spanish Empire). An additional $900,000 would indemnify the revolutionaries who stayed in the Philippines; in return for surrendering their weapons, they were granted amnesty and the Spanish government promised reforms.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Gregorio del Pilar</h3>
                    <p>Gregorio del Pilar was one of the youngest generals of the Philippine Army. At the onset of the revolution, and in response to reports of "successive triumphs" in Cavite, some 3,000 revolutionary forces marched to seize the town of Paombong, Bulacan, forming a military government. Del Pilar was among those who marched towards Paombong, although there are also rumors of him being present during the Cry of Balintawak. Del Pilar was eventually assigned to the forces of Eusebio Roque in Kakarong de Sili, a fort near the town of Pandi. On New Year's day, 1897, del Pilar participated in the defense of Kakarong de Sili, managing to escape with only 9 others before the Spanish overran the fort. His courage and bravery in that action won him recognition and a promotion to the rank of lieutenant. He eventually left Roque’s unit after the man was sold out to the Spanish by his own soldiers and executed on February 1897, and began to make his way to Imus, Cavite, reaching as far as Montalban in February. He eventually returned to Bulacan and joined Adriano Gatmaitan's army, being promoted to captain in the process. <br> As captain, del Pilar managed feats of bravery. He once mananged to singlehandedly ambush a priest and his escort of cazadores from Mambog on their way to Malolos. He shot of the cazadores which prompted the rest to flee. This act netted him several Mauser rifles and four sacks of coins, which he distributed to his troops. He decreed that married men be given 50 pesos each, unmarried ones 25 pesos, and the remaining money be sent to Manila to buy a blanket and a cloak for each soldier. On September 3, 1897, del Pilar executed an attack on the Spanish garrison in the town of Paombong. He and ten other men slipped into town in the night and fell upon the cazadores in the basement of the convent during Sunday mass. Del Pilar himself was stationed in the plaza, firing at the second story of the convent to prevent any men from approaching from the windows. They were eventually able to capture 14 Mauser rifles. Other versions of the raid vary, however. Some tellings talk about how del Pilar and his men slipped into town dressed as women, while other versions have them disguised as cazadores.</p>

                    <p>Teodoro Plata is one of the founding members of the Katipunan. In 1892, he served as the secretary of the group with Arellano as president. In 1893, under the presidency of Román Basa, Plata served as councilor and it was at this time that the Katipunan organized a women's auxiliary section. One of its first members was Plata's cousin Gregoria de Jesús, who wrote in her autobiography that Plata was Bonifacio's constant companion when he would call at their house in Caloocan to court her. In August 1896, immediately before the discovery of the Katipunan, Plata was elected secretary of war in the last Supreme Council that was constituted by Bonifacio like a government cabinet. When the Spanish started arresting Katipunan members of August 19, 1896, Bonifacio called for a general assembly at Pugadlawin, a place in Balintawak. The meeting on August 23 was attended by about 1,000 Katipuneros and there ensued a debate on whether they should commit themselves to an uprising. Plata opposed the declaration of hostilities because they had few arms and ammunition. But the final vote decided on starting the rebellion and the Katipuneros tore their residence and identity certificates. A few weeks later, however, Plata was arrested and, after a military trial, he was executed by musketry on February 6, 1897 along with Apolonio de la Cruz, Vicente Molina, and a few others.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-weight-normal mt-0 mb-4">Valentin Diaz</h3>
                    <p>Valentin Diaz was with former Liga members, like Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa, and Jose Dizon, when Bonifacio founded the Katipunan, a secret revolutionary society, during a meeting at the house of Deodato Arellano at No. 72 Azcarraga Street, Tondo, on July 7, 1892. Before the outbreak of the 1896 Revolution, Diaz already held the rank of major in the revolutionary army. He figured in the negotiation of the surrender of Tarlac on July 10, 1898, a successful siege of the town by Francisco Makabulos. He was one of the signatories of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, which was promulgated on November 1, 1897. Later, he joined other revolutionaries who went in self-exile in Hong Kong in keeping with the conditions of the pact. During the Filipino-American War (1899-1902), he served as colonel in the Philippine Army. Diaz died in Manila in 1916 at the age of 67.</p>
